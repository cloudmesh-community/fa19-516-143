**Ex4. I will cover "wind" (7 mod 6)**

Data centers powered by wind come in two varieties - those that are powered by utility power that is sourced from 
wind generators and those that are powered directly by on-site wind generators (1).  

Data centers currently generated by on-site wind generators include:
* Other World Computing in Woodstock, Illinois (2009) - first data center to be entiredly powered by wind in U.S. (1)
* Baryonyx Corporation in Stratford, Texas (2009) - powered by wind turbine leases on and off shore (1)

Data centers planned with on-site wind generators:
* Google in Land of Lakes, MN (announced 2019) - 300MW data center with two wind farms (2)

Data centers currently powered by utility power from wind generators:
* Green House Data in Cheyenne, Wyoming (2007) - 10,000 sqft data center run entirely by wind (1), with an average 
PUE of 1.25 or lower (3).  Data center includes other optimizations such as hot/cold aisles, power and temperature 
tracking, renewable energy credits (3)
* Microsoft Virtual Earth Boulder, Colorado 2008 (1,4) - using three shipping containers placed near energy sources 
as a model for future efficiency (1, 4), the data center is "100 percent wind powered" through offsets (1, 4)

A continuation of Microsoft's concept is seen in Germany's WasfalenWind-Group, a company planning to put small data 
centers inside wind turbines (5). This project was announced in 2018, and is project aimed primarily at cloud services, 
using 62U server racks in each turbine, with 92% of the power coming from home turbine (5).

**Ex5. I picked Germany**

Germany was the largest energy consumer in Europe and the 7th in the world in 2015 (1), but required imports (1) to 
drive it's coal and nuclear power structure (2).  The government set a goal to obtain 65% of its electricity from 
renewable power by 2030 (2) and 80% by 2050 (1), partly characterised by it's Energiewend project to phase out coal 
and nuclear (1), including the closing of all nuclear plants by 2022 (1).  

These projects have been largely successful, with 30% of electricity coming from renewable sources in 2015 (1), 40.4% in
2018 (2), and 65% in 2019 (2).  Of this, wind was the largest contributing source (48.4%), followed by biomass (7.6%), 
solar (5.1%), and hydropower (3.5%) (2).  In contrast, power from lignite coal was down to 12% in 2019 from 24% in 2018 (2).

Germany is working on providing cloud data centers inside of individual wind turbines (3), which have 92% of their power 
coming from the host turbine (with the rest coming from redundant power sources and other turbines) (3).

**Ex8. Data Center Outage: Reddit outage 8/31/19**

Amazon Web Services hosts the popular online forum Reddit (1).  Unlike Twitter's outage on the same day (2), this outage 
was not related to high traffic on a U.S. holiday.  Reddit was down in Northern Europe, parts of Asia, North America, and 
Southern Australia (map at www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/reddit-experiencing-outage-due-to-amazon-aws-issue/). 
The outage lasted approximately six hours (1) and impacted seven Reddit companies - including desktop and mobile sites as 
well as comment processing (1).  Downdectector.com reported 15,531 reports of the site being down within one hour and over 
91,000 reports reported within the six hour outage (graph at 
https://downdetector.com/status/reddit/news/264740-problems-at-reddit-14).  As reddit does not have a sales section like 
facebook, so financial impact to users was limited.  However, Reddit is largely monitized by ads (4), but no value per 
hour was able to be found.
